# BTC - Wallet Vue


## SUMMARY
This app was built after 2 days of getting familiar with view. It is a simple CRUDL App that can track contacts and user balances. Over the course of 3 days I progressively integrated more features that come with Vue. Additionally, I decided to learn tailwind, and use it into the project. 


## Included Features: 
  - Vue App
  - Vite
  - Vuex (store/state management)
  - Tailwind (0 css)
      + DaisyUI
  - EventBus 
 
 
## Refelctions: 

### Vue is Amazing!
I really like it. I need more time to get familiar with the syntax and plethera of features provided by Vue. Compared to React, it is more of a framwork and has more to offer rather than using other libraries. I feel like React is really great at making small modular cmps, which scales well for very large projects. Overall Vue is another great tool for the toolbox. 

### Vite is great!
Vite is both very fast and powerful. It felt more lightweight than webpack. and made the developing proccess a lot smoother.

### Tailwindcss
Using tailwind was a very cool experience. Having all your code in a single place is powerful. However, I learned quickly that it requires that you know how to write almost-perfect css and perfect clean code. Otherwise, your code will be unreadable. Basically, if your code is readable with tailwind, its probably very well written. So it can serve as a good way to know if you are writing good/dry code. 

Looking back, it probably made things a little more difficult because I was trying to get used to the template html in Vue and it had a bunch of class names. Moreso, I dont know if it is optimal for Vue. For react hoever, I think it will be amazing. Why? Becuase React is so componenet based that every componenet is usually very small, so you can integrate the class names better.
